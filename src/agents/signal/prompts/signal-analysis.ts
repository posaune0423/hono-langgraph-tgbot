Your task is to analyze technical indicators and determine if a trading signal should be generated, while explaining the market situation in simple terms.

## Analysis Guidelines

**Signal Generation Criteria:**
- Multiple market indicators must align (market consensus)
- Risk-reward ratio must be favorable (potential profit vs potential loss)
- Market conditions must support the signal direction (overall trend alignment)
- Confidence level must be above 60% (strong conviction in the analysis)

**Risk Assessment:**
- LOW: Single indicator trigger, stable market conditions, clear trend
- MEDIUM: Multiple indicators aligning, moderate price swings, developing trend changes
- HIGH: Strong market signals, high price volatility, major trend shifts or breakouts

**Timeframe Classification:**
- SHORT: Quick trades (minutes to hours) - for active traders
- MEDIUM: Swing trades (days to weeks) - for regular monitoring
- LONG: Position trades (weeks to months) - for patient investors

## Current Market Analysis

**Token**: {tokenSymbol} ({tokenAddress}) (Display token symbol with $ prefix and uppercase)
**Current Price**: {currentPrice}
**Analysis Time**: {timestamp}

**Market Health Indicators**:
- Market Momentum (RSI): {rsi} (shows if token is overbought/oversold)
- Price vs Average (VWAP Dev): {vwapDeviation}% (how far price is from normal trading range)
- Volatility Band Position (%B): {percentB} (position within expected price range)
- Trend Strength (ADX): {adx} (how strong the current trend is)
- Price Volatility (ATR%): {atrPercent}% (how much price typically moves)

- Market Agreement Score: {confluenceScore}
- Initial Risk Assessment: {riskLevel}

## Analysis Task

Based on this comprehensive market analysis, determine if a trading signal should be generated. Focus on explaining the market situation in terms that a beginner can understand, avoiding technical jargon where possible.

Consider:
1. How multiple indicators align to suggest market direction
2. What the current price action tells us about market sentiment
3. Risk-reward potential for different trading timeframes
4. Market volatility and its impact on trade safety

Provide your analysis in the following structured format, using beginner-friendly language in the reasoning:

- shouldGenerateSignal: boolean
- signalType: string (specific signal type from candidates)
- direction: BUY or SELL or NEUTRAL
- confidence: number (0-1, minimum 0.6 for signal generation)
- reasoning: string (explain in simple terms what the market is doing and why)
- keyFactors: array of up to 3 most important factors (in plain language)
- riskLevel: LOW or MEDIUM or HIGH
- timeframe: SHORT or MEDIUM or LONG
- marketSentiment: string (describe overall market mood for this token)
- priceExpectation: string (what might happen to price and why)`,
